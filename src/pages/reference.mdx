{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm install @d3oxy/djs-commands
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    pnpm install @d3oxy/djs-commands 
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

### Add env variables

```bash
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=... # A secret key for your app (starts with sk_live_)
```

<Callout type="info">
    If you're not deploying through Vercel, you also need to add a
    `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable that points to your app, e.g.
    `https://myapp.com`. This variable can also be used to override the default
    URL in development which is `http://localhost:3000` unless specified
    otherwise.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from
  the [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Callout>
